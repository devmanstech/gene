#0.3.0

 - Breaking changes: Changed how wishes are registered. Now you
 can only register with objects and arrays of objects. You can't
 register by parameters. There were just too many parameters,
 and everyone using this was using objects/arrays anyway.
 Also changing context a tad internally. Now all context will
 be created as an object. Though a string or array can still
 be provided, it will be assigned to the `context.any` property.
 - Update to the matching algorithm to improve suggestions.
 - Genie now adds a `data` property to all wishes with a
 `timesMade` object indicating how many times that wish had
 been made (how many times the action was called) total as well
 as with specific magic words.
 - Added getWishesWithContext(context, type, wishContextTypes)
 - Added getWishesInContext(context)
 - Added getWish(id)
 - Added overrideMatchingAlgorithm(function(wishes, magicWord, enteredMagicWords){}).
 See README.
 - Adding autodocs
 - Added restoreMatchingAlgorithm()
 - Seriously documented some functions.
 - Adding jshint to the build. Some errors corrected.
 - Old tests fixed/removed
 - Updated README accordingly

#0.2.5

 allowing for more fine control over what wishes are in context and
 which are not.

 magic words, but the entry in the entered magic words remained even
 if it was empty.

#0.2.3
