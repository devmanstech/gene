GenieJS
=====
*Genie* |ˈjēnē| (noun): a spirit of Arabian folklore, as traditionally depicted imprisoned
within a bottle or oil lamp, and capable of granting wishes when summoned.

Watered Down Explanation
--
GenieJS is a simple library to emulate the same kind of behavior seen in apps like
[Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/). Essentially, you register actions associated with
keywords. Then you can request the genie to perform that action based on the best keyword
match for a given keyword.

Over time, the genie will learn the actions more associated with specific keywords and
those will be come first when a list of matching actions is requested. If that didn't
make sense, don't worry, hopefully the tutorial, tests, and demo will help explain how
it works.

Vernacular

*Wish*: An object with an id, action, and magic words.

*Action*: What to call when this wish is to be executed.

*Magic Word*: Keywords for a wish used to match it with given magic words.

How to use it
--
Include the regular script tag:

```
<script src="./vendor/genie.js"></script>
```

This will place `genie` on the global namespace for your delight. `genie` is a
function with a few useful functions as properties of `genie`. The flow of
using GenieJS is simple:

```
/* Register wishes */
// One magic word
var trashWish = genie('Take out the trash', function() {
  console.log('Yes! I love taking out the trash!');
});
// Multiple magic words
var vacuumWish = genie(['Get dust out of the carpet', 'vacuum'], function() {
  console.log('Can NOT wait to get that dust out of that carpet!');
});

/* Get wishes based on magic word matches */
genie.getMatchingWishes('vacuum'); // returns [vacuumWish];
genie.getMatchingWishes('out'); // returns [trashWish, vacuumWish];

// Make wish based on wish object or id of wish object
genie.makeWish(trashWish.id); // logs: 'Yes! I love taking out the trash!'
genie.makeWish(vacuumWish); // logs: 'Can NOT wait to get that dust out of that carpet!'
```

So far it doesn't look too magical, but the true magic comes in the form of genie giving
preference to wishes that were recently chosen with a given keyword. To do this, you need
to provide genie with a magic word to associate the wish with, like so:

```
genie.makeWish(vacuumWish, 'out'); // logs as above
genie.getMatchingWishes('out'); // returns [vacuumWish, trashWish]; <-- Notice difference from above
```

As you'll notice, the order of the two wishes is changed because genie gave preference
to the `vacuumWish` because the last time `makeWish` was called with the the `'out'`
magic word, `vacuumWish` was the wish given.

This behavior simulates apps such as [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) which is the
goal of this library!

Other interesting stuff
--
The `wishObject` has the following structure:
```
var wish = {
  id: 'string',
  keywords: ['string'],
  action: function() { }
};
```
The `enteredMagicWords` object has the following structure:
```
var enteredMagicWords = {
  'Any Magic Word': ['wishId1', 'wishId2', 'wishId3'],
  'Another magic word': ['wishId1', 'wishId2', 'wishId3']
};
```

You have the following api to use at your discretion:

```
genie(magicWords [string || array | required], action [function | required], id [string | optional]);
// If no id is provided, one will be auto-generated via the previousId + 1

genie.deregisterWish(id [string || wishObject | required]);
// Removes the wish from the registered wishes and the enteredMagicWords

genie.clearWishes();
// Clears all wishes and enteredMagicWords

genie.getMatchingWishes(magicWord [string | required]);
/* 
 * Returns an array of wishes which match in order:
 *  1. Most recently made wishes with the given magicWord
 *  2. Following the order of their initial registration
 */

genie.makeWish(id [string || wishObject | required], magicWord [string | optional]);
/* 
 * Executes the given wish's action.
 * If a magicWord is provided, adds the given wish to the enteredMagicWords
 * to be given preferential treatment of order in the array returned
 * by the getMatchingWishes method.
 */

genie.options({
  wishes: [object | optional],
  previousId: [number | optional],
  enteredMagicWords: [object | optional]
});
/*
 * Returns the current genie options.
 *  1. wishes: All wishes (wishObject described above) currently registered
 *  2. previousId: The number used to auto-generate wish Ids if an id is not
 *    provided when a wish is registered.
 *  3. enteredMagicWords: All magicWords which have been associated with wishes
 *    to give preferential treatment in the order of wishes returned by getMatchingWishes
 */
```
