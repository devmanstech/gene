  Genie can give you a list of intelligently organized wishes which are in context for a given <code>magicWord</code>
  based on a priority calculated by a <a href="https://github.com/kentcdodds/genie#about-matching-priority">sorting algorithm</a>.
  Let's say the magic word we've given genie to match is "<b>At</b>".
  <ol>
    <li>* King of the Hill for the given <code>magicWords</code> (genie will <a href="https://github.com/kentcdodds/genie#about-optimistic-anticipation">optimistically anticipate</a> this)</li>
    <li>* On Deck for the given <code>magicWords</code> (also optimistically anticipated)</li>
    <li><b>At</b> - Equal - If the given magic word is equal to any magic words of a wish</li>
    <li><b>At</b>Task Rocks! - Starts With - If the given magic word is the start to any magic word of a wish</li>
    <li>Love <b>At</b>Task! - Word Starts With - If the given magic word is the start to any word in a magic word</li>
    <li>Love c<b>at</b>s - Contained - If the given magic word is contained in any magic words of a wish</li>
    <li><b>A</b>lligator <b>T</b>ime! - Acronym - If the given magic word is an acronym of any magic words of a wish</li>
    <li>H<b>a</b>ppily Ever Af<b>t</b>er - Simple Match - If the given magic word matches the order of characters in any magic words of a wish.</li>
  </ol>
  <div style="margin-top:10px">
    <strong>Note:</strong> if two wishes match equally, then the one which was most recently registered is returned first.
    Also, because wishes can have an array of magic words, if two wishes match equally, but one's match is first in that
    array and the other is second in the array, the first one will win even if it was more recently registered.
  </div>
  <div style="margin-top:10px">
    <b>*</b> The first priority in the list is where genie learns the user as it is used. As wishes are made with a specific magic
    word, it becomes the "King of the Hill" for that magic word. If another wish is made with the same magic word, then
    it becomes "On Deck." If this on deck wish is made with that same magic word it will then become "King of the Hill"
    and the previous king becomes on deck.

    As a final note, you can provide your own matching algorithm if you want to using <code>genie.overrideMatchingAlgorithm...</code>
