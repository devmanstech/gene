<div>
  To get a little more control over the lamp, you can have the following setup:
  <pre>&lt;div
  ux-lamp
  lamp-visible="genieVisible"
  rub-class="visible"
  rub-shortcut="32"
  rub-modifier="ctrlKey"
  rub-event-type="keypress"
  wish-callback="wishMade(wish)"
  local-storage="genie-&lt;user-id&gt;"
  firebase="http://&lt;firebase-name&gt;.firebaseio.com/genie/&lt;user-id&gt;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
  <div>
    <h3>Attributes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><code>ux-lamp</code> - The directive itself.</li>
      <li>
        <code>lamp-visible</code> - A doubly bound variable which controls the visibility of the lamp.
        (Toggles between true and false when the lamp is rubbed.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>rub-class</code> - The class to give the lamp when it should be visible. Useful for CSS transitions.
        If excluded, the lamp will simply appear/disappear when rubbed.</li>
      <li>
        <code>rub-shortcut</code> - The character code or character to bind as a shortcut to rub the lamp.
        Defaults to 32 (space keyCode).
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>rub-modifier</code> - A modifier key to be pressed to rub the lamp (ie ctrlKey, metaKey, shiftKey, altKey).
        Defaults to ctrlKey.</li>
      <li>
        <code>rub-event-type</code> - The type of event to bind the lamp rubbing shortcut to
        (like keypress, keyup, or keydown).
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>wish-callback</code> - A function to call when a wish is made (i.e. the user clicks or presses enter on
        a wish). The wish which was made is passed to this as an argument.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>local-storage</code> & <code>firebase</code> - These cannot be used together as they perform the same
        function. Use one or the other. These options persist genie's enteredMagicWords to localStorage (if available)
        or firebase. You must have the Firebase global constructor function for firebase to work.
      </li>
    </ul>
