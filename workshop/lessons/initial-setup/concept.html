  This is the initial setup for the Genie-Workshop. Here are a few things of interest before you begin:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Even though this workshop uses AngularJS, <code>genie</code> itself has <em>no</em> dependencies.
      However, <code>ux-genie</code> <em>is</em> an AngularJS module and therefore depends on AngularJS.
    </li>
    <li>Navigate from lesson to lesson via the links above.</li>
    <li>
      There are a few sections for each concept:
      <ol>
        <li>Explanation: A brief description of the concept</li>
        <li>
          Play around: A fully editable text area you can use to play around with genie.
          The code there can be re-run and any output to console.log will go to the Output block below.

      </ol>

  The process to setup your project to use <code>genie</code> is pretty simple.
  Simply insert a <code>script</code> tag before your <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>
  tag with the source to your genie file. Like so:
  <pre>&lt;script src="/vendor/genie.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
  <small>*If you're using ux-genie, you'll want to do the same with ux-genie,
    except make sure you include it before you load your own module.</small>
