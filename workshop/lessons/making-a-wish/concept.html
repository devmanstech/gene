<div>
  When a wish is made, a few things happen. First genie checks that the wish is
  <a href="https://github.com/kentcdodds/genie#about-context">in context</a>. If it is, then the wish's action is invoked.
  If a <code>magicWord</code> is provided, then genie internally associates that magic word with that wish for better
  sorting in the future. This is how genie learns the user as time goes on (more on this later).<br />
  Genie will also increment the wish's <code>data.timesMade.total</code> and <code>data.timesMade.magicWords[magicWord]</code>
  values.
