  The lamp can set a temporary sub context. Let's say you have a lot of posts to search through, and you want to expose
  those with genie so users can find the post they want to quickly. You can create a sub context wish with the
  magicWord "Search Posts:" and when it is made, the context will be temporarily set to 'posts' and all the post
  wishes would show up because their context is set to 'post'. It's easier to demonstrate this. See below :-)
