<div>
  In web applications, many times the context of the app is represented by the url. So you can have this
  be true with genie as well. For example, if you have an email app, you can have the <code>/inbox</code>
  and the <code>/message/:id</code> routes which would have different contexts. Instead of managing this
  yourself, genie can help you a little. Genie will not watch the URL for you, so you have to do that
  yourself. At any time, you can call genie.updatePathContext(window.location.pathname) and genie will
  update its context. You have control over what's in this array using the <code>genie.addPathContext(pathContext)</code>
  and the <code>genie.removePathContext(pathContext)</code> methods.
