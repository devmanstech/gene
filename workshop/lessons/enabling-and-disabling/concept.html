    You can disable and re-enable genie using the <code>enabled(false)</code> function. Doing this will prevent <strong>any</strong>
    functions from actually executing in genie (with the exception of <code>enabled</code> so you can re-enable it).

    As a helper so you don't have to check your code for nulls all over the place, by default genie will return an empty
    object/string/array/whatever makes sense for each function. You can disable this behavior by calling
    <code>returnOnDisabled(false)</code>.
